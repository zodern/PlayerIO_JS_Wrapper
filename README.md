Player.IO Javascript Wrapper
============================

A wrapper so you can use Player.IO API in Javascript.
Since there is not yet a Javascript API available for Player.IO, I decided to make a wrapper using Flash and Javascript.
This was made so people can use the Player.IO API in Javascript using a Flash backend.

It is far from complete, but some things already work and I wanted to share my work if someone is interested.
